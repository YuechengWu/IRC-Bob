# ############################################################ #
# A method that lets 1-6 players in the chat play blackjack.   #
# ############################################################ #
# Works but needs a few tweaks. Mainly letting the bot draw    #
# if he has less than 16 points, insta blackjack on player 21  #
# and letting the A be either 1 or 11, currently just 11.      #
